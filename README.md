# Linear Regression from Scratch

Definition: In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between adependent and independents variables. The case with single independent variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

y = mx + c

In the above equation, y acts as the independent variable while x is the dependent variable since one independent variable is used; hence this equation refers to a simple linear regression equation.

In this repository, I have implemented simple linear regression model from scratch.
